# weather_report
# Objective
Calculate the average values and analyze trends for various weather parameters over the full timespan covered in the provided weather data, dropping any NaN and other non-numeric values. Additionally, perform data analysis tasks using NumPy and create plots to visualize the trends over time.
# Data Description
The data file contains hourly weather observations with the following abbreviations and meanings:

|Abbreviation|Meaning|
|---|---|
|TA|Temperature Average|
|RH|Relative Humidity|
|WS|Wind Speed|
|WD|Wind Direction|
|PRA|Precipitation Amount|
|PRI|Precipitation Intensity|
|PA|Pressure Average|
|WAWA|Most Significant Weather Code|	

# Instruction
1. Open the provided CSV file named [CSV_NAME] containing the hourly weather observations.

2. Calculate the average values for the following parameters over the entire timespan covered in the data, disregarding any NaN and other non-numeric values:

  * Relative Humidity
  * Temperature Average
  * Wind Speed
  * Precipitation Amount
  * Pressure Average
3. Perform the following tasks using NumPy:

  * For each parameter, calculate the minimum, maximum, and median values.
  * Find the hour with the highest value for each parameter.
4. Create plots to visualize the trends of the following parameters over time:

  * Relative Humidity
  * Temperature Average
  * Wind Speed
  * Precipitation Amount
  * Pressure Average
5. Write the calculated average values for each parameter
